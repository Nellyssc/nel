                For patients who have been confined to their beds for a life time the moisture alarm will be a relief. This is so as their needs are well catered for with the bed wetting alarm. The medical field has made numerous steps to ensure man lives and dies a dignified death. Patients are always well taken care of till their last breath.
Introduction of palliative care for patient’s wellbeing and hope for terminally ill patients is one of the improvements in the medical field. When one is bedridden and can hardly speak due to his medical condition one needs greater care so as not to fall into depression. The aftermath of some diseases leave the patient unable to speak and this is really frustrating as they are unable to voice out their thoughts. They depend entirely on their caregiver’s instincts for their well - being. If the care giver is not keen enough the already suffering patient may be again afflicted with bed wounds. This should not be so at this era of technology.
Over the years various improvements have been made to improve the hospital bed to ensure comfort during the hospital stay. In the 1900’s the gatch bed was designed by D Gatch of the
